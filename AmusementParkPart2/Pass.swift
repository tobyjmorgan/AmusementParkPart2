    // Mark: for protocol ReswipeCheckable
    
    // N.B. I wanted all this to be captured in an extension to the ReswipeCheckable
    // protocol as a base implementation, but due to the mutating nature of the
    // method and that stored properties cannot be added in an extension, I couldn't
    // make that work. So here it is implemented in Pass
    
    // if the pass is swiped again within 60 seconds, it is considered a reswipe
    let thresholdForReswipe: TimeInterval = 60
    
    // setting the last swipe to distant past initially
    var lastSwipeTime: Date = Date.distantPast

    func isTryingToReswipe() -> Bool {
        
        // make a temporary copy of the last time this pass was swiped for ride access
        let tempLastSwipe = lastSwipeTime
        
        // update lastSwipeTime to now, ready for any future checks
        lastSwipeTime = Date()
        
        // return true if the interval between this swipe and the last swipe is less than our threshold
        if Date().timeIntervalSince1970 - tempLastSwipe.timeIntervalSince1970 < thresholdForReswipe {
